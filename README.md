### about

teensnext seeks to be a universal platform where members of a community can locally source assistance for simple tasks, i.e., primarily in the form of volunteering and providing a location-based networking systems to help people meet each other and enjoy events and places in their area. unlike other networking platforms, teensnext seeks to localize the scope of social activity so that users are far more unified with their environment and can feel more safe when interacting with other people online.

### stack

dart and flutter come together to form a beautiful frontend that heightens the user experience while helping to create a simple app to use. google's firebase helps handle the data and their authentication apis deliver secure verification systems (google, facebook, and apple) for users. flutter's provider state management system is minimial yet helps the app operate smoothly to handle callbacks and asynchronous functions.
